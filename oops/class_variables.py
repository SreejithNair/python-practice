# There are two types of Python attributes, instance attributes, and class attributes.
# The attributes of a class are also referred to as variables
# Depending on the scope, variables can also be categorized into two types: Local variables and Global variables

# A local variable in a class is a variable that can only be accessed inside
# the code block where it is defined. For instance, if you define a variable inside a method,
# it cannot be accessed anywhere outside that method

#A global variable is defined outside of any code block e.g method, if-statements, etc.
# A global variable can be accessed anywhere in the class. Take a look at the following example.
